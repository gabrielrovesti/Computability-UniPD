The exam consists of a written test, requiring the solution of some exercises. The exam is closed-book: you will not be allowed to consult books or any other material. An oral exam is required only for getting the highest grade (30 cum laude). This means that students obtaining a grade between 18 and 30 in the written test can simply keep their grade. The (optional) oral exam must be taken in the same session of the written exam. After each written test, student can (and are suggested to, especially if they did not pass) consult the correction of their exam.
